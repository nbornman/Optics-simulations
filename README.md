# Optics-simulations
The purpose of this programme is to simulate a wide variety of phenomena in optics, such as turbulence, different laser modes, beam propagation, the process of modulating a beam using an SLM, etc. I have endeavoured to make as few simplifying assumptions as possible, therefore a few of the expressions used below are more general and will hence look different from those commonly used in, for example, the Fresnel and Frauenhofer approximations.
